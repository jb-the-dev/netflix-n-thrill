# V2

In this version, all CRUD functionality works in both backend and frontend

## Fixes

### Accurate incrementation of `show_id` when POSTing
Not the best fix, but hardcoded a line of SQL into the table migration file that sets auto-incrementation to begin at 8808, which is the next value following the csv file. Incrementing works as "expected" as long as the csv file of 8,807 shows is seeded first.

### Service.read() now operational
Simple fix; just forgot to add async/await. Confusion partially stemmed from copy-pasting from another project, which led to 2 different kinds of syntax being used to define functions. 

## If there was more time...
NB! see `notes.md` for the first set of updates I'd make. The updates below are all updates not explicitly mentioned in the first list.
- **NEW**: Would learn how to add abortControllers into all axios calls
- **NEW**: Would separate the handlers from the ShowList component into a separate file
- **NEW**: deployed the app, likely on Heroku as it's familiar; but not against trying new hosting services if having plenty of time.
- **NEW**: ran the deployed app through an accessibility checker to ensure it was current to modern standards
- Upgraded it cosmetically by picking a color scheme & font, **NEW** --> added space between buttons, some kind of border between columns or rows to help guide the eyes
